## Features

### 1. **User Authentication and Role Management**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define specific roles for users such as Admin, Agent, and Customer, each with tailored permissions and responsibilities.
- **OAuth/Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Seamless login integration for business environments, allowing users to log in using existing credentials from corporate systems.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Additional security for Admins and Agents to ensure secure access to sensitive systems and data.

### 2. **Ticket Management System**

- **Auto-Assignment & Routing**: Automatically assign tickets to available agents based on round-robin or workload-based rules, with the flexibility to manually reassign tickets when needed.
- **Priority Levels & SLA Compliance**: Set ticket priorities (High, Medium, Low) and ensure response and resolution times meet defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs), with alerts for overdue tickets.
- **Bulk Ticket Actions**: Support for bulk actions like closing, merging, or assigning multiple tickets at once to help agents manage high volumes efficiently.

### 3. **Reporting and Analytics**

- **Detailed Reports**: Generate reports on ticket resolution rates, agent performance, and monthly statistics, with filtering options by agent, department, or date.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Intuitive, real-time dashboard displaying metrics such as ticket status, average resolution time, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Resolution Insights**: Analyze customer feedback and resolution patterns to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement.

### 4. **Excel Import and User Management**

- **Bulk User Upload**: Admins can upload an Excel file to add multiple users or agents to the system, with real-time error validation and prompts for corrections.
- **Automatic Notifications**: Upon adding users, automatic welcome emails with login instructions and system guidelines are sent to facilitate smooth onboarding.

### 5. **Automated Notifications and Alerts**

- **Event-Based Notifications**: Users receive instant notifications (SMS, email, or push) when a ticket is created, updated, or resolved, based on their preferences.
- **Escalation Alerts**: Automated reminders and escalation alerts for unresolved high-priority tickets, ensuring timely resolution.

### 6. **Agent Collaboration and Issue Resolution**

- **Internal Agent Chat**: Agents can collaborate in real time within the platform, discussing complex issues and documenting troubleshooting steps for future reference.
- **Closure Reason Tracking**: Agents must select or input a closure reason when resolving tickets, enabling better tracking and analysis of ticket outcomes.

### 7. **Detailed Ticket History and Audit Trail**

- **Ticket Activity Log**: Each ticket features a comprehensive log of all actions, such as ticket creation, reassignment, and resolution, along with timestamps and user details.
- **Customer View**: Customers can access a summarized view of ticket progress and past resolutions for transparency.

### 8. **Dashboard and Embeddable Widgets**

- **Interactive Dashboard**: An admin-focused dashboard displays trends, performance metrics, and other key insights in a user-friendly interface.
- **Embeddable Widgets**: Admins can embed widgets like ticket counts or forms directly into external websites or internal portals, making them more accessible.

### 9. **Initial Query Interface (BOT)**

- **Structured Query Interface**: Upon login, users are prompted with a set of questions (e.g., office location, designation) to direct them to the appropriate support flow.
- **FAQ and Chat Integration**: Based on responses, the system either offers relevant FAQs or routes users to the chat interface for further assistance.

### 10. **User Feedback and Satisfaction Tracking**

- **Post-Resolution Feedback**: Customers can provide feedback on their experience after a ticket is closed, offering insights into areas for improvement.
- **Satisfaction Reports**: Generate reports that compile customer satisfaction ratings to evaluate agent performance and identify improvement opportunities.

### 11. **Self-Service Portal**

- **Knowledge Base Integration**: A searchable knowledge base provides users with answers to common questions and troubleshooting guides, reducing the need for agent intervention.
- **Chatbot Integration**: A chatbot assists with common queries, escalating to a human agent only when necessary, offering quick responses and efficient service.
